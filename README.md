# SSGMatrix
This was my own take on Matrix screensavers which were quite popular when
Matrix Revolutions came out back in 2003. The screen savers that were 
around back then were too bloated for my taste. I just wanted a simple one, 
so I coded this in an hour or so. That was the time when RADs were rad.

I later added support for multi monitors and it seems to be working
fine still.

Also Lazarus conversion ran right away without any touches to the code.
